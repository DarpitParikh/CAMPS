How to run locally
1) Create venv and install deps: pip install -r requirements.txt (or existing venv).
2) Set env vars as needed (DJANGO_SECRET_KEY, DJANGO_DEBUG=True for local).
3) Run migrations: python manage.py migrate.
4) Start server: python manage.py runserver.

Production notes
- Use Postgres (recommended) instead of SQLite for multi-user deployment.
- Run collectstatic: python manage.py collectstatic --noinput (staticfiles dir).
- Set DEBUG=False, configure ALLOWED_HOSTS/CSRF origins, and serve static/media via web server or platform defaults.

Authentication flow
- Login page posts to Django auth view; auth_views.py handles login/logout; templates show errors; dashboards are protected.

Seating/Allocation flow
- allocate.html shows form (views.py) to generate seating; preview.html renders arrangement.

Students/Subjects/Attendance
- CRUD via views/forms/templates; attendance marking page for faculty/admin.

Testing
- allocation/tests.py: Placeholder/tests for allocation app (extend as needed).
