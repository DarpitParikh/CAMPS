# Campus Academic Management and Planning System

## Overview
A faculty-oriented Academic & Examination Management System built for LDRP Institute of Technology and Research. Designed to replace Excel-based workflows with a simple, smart, time-saving internal portal.

**Project Type:** 8th Semester CSE Project
**Built With:** Python Django + HTML + SQLite

---

## 📋 Core Features Implemented

### 1. **Faculty-Only Login (Role-Based)**
- Admin (Exam Cell) & Faculty roles
- Session-based authentication
- Faculty can only edit their own subjects
- Admin controls all structure and exam operations

### 2. **Semester-Wise Student Management**
- Store students with roll number, name, branch, semester
- Global search by roll number, name, or enrollment number
- Filter by branch and semester
- Add new students (Admin only)

### 3. **Student Profile Page** ⭐ Key Differentiator
One complete page showing:
- Basic student details (roll number, enrollment, branch, semester)
- Attendance summary (subject-wise percentage)
- Marks summary (internal + external, total, grade, pass/fail)
- Exam seating info (exam number, room, seat)

### 4. **Daily Attendance** ✅ Faster Than Excel
- Faculty selects subject + date
- Student list loads automatically
- Default: Present (faculty clicks only to mark absent)
- One-click save with auto percentage calculation
- Context memory: remembers last subject used

### 5. **Marks Management**
- Subject-wise marks entry
- Internal + External marks input
- Auto total calculation
- Grade assignment (A+, A, B+, B, C, F)
- Pass/fail logic (>=40 passes)
- Max marks validation
- Safe-edit: Lock after final submit

### 6. **Automated Exam Seating + Direct Print**
- Input: total students, students per room
- Auto room allocation algorithm
- Handles leftover students intelligently
- Print-ready PDF output
- Shows current allocation status

### 7. **Smart Dashboard**
- **Admin Dashboard:** Overview of students, subjects, faculty, recent activities
- **Faculty Dashboard:** Quick access to subjects, pending work indicators
- Context memory: Shows last accessed subject

## 💾 Database Models

### Academic Structure
- **Branch** - Engineering branches (CE, ME, EC, EE, CS)
- **Semester** - Semester numbers (1-8)
- **Subject** - Subject code, name, max marks (internal + external)

### People
- **Faculty** - Teacher info, subjects taught, last accessed subject/semester
- **Student** - Roll number, name, branch, semester, exam seating info

### Academic Records
- **StudentSubject** - Student-Subject enrollment
- **Attendance** - Daily attendance records (Present/Absent)
- **Marks** - Subject-wise marks (internal, external, total, grade)

### Exam Seating
- **CESeating** - Room allocation data

---

## 🔐 Access Control

### Admin (Exam Cell)
- ✓ View all students
- ✓ Add/edit students
- ✓ Manage exam seating
- ✓ Download PDF reports
- ✓ View all attendance/marks

### Faculty
- ✓ View only assigned students
- ✓ Mark attendance for their subjects
- ✓ Enter marks for their subjects
- ✓ Submit & lock marks (prevent accidental changes)
